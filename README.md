# The datafinder R package

### What is datafinder?
The datafinder R package allows users to find currently installed data frames, understand what types of variables exist in the data frames, and visualize many of these variables at once. This pipeline takes analytics projects from a nascent stage to model building, whether that be for statistics students/professors or researchers with other projects in mind. Soon datafinder will report even more information about installed data frames such as:

* Is there missing data? 
* How many factors levels are there? 
* Are numerical variables normally distributed?
    
We specifically hope this package will be especially useful for statistics educators who are always on the lookout for example data sets that have specific qualities needed for the topic at hand.

### Which license are we using?
This package is distributed with the GPLv3 license. 

### How can you contribute?
There are many ways you can contribute! We hope that you will recommend bug fixes, new features, and general improvements that benefit both you and other users. 

### How can you install datafinder?
Installing datafinder is easy. Currently, the only way to get this package is through github using the below code.

``` r
devtools::install_github("VectorPosse/datafinder") 
```

If you see any errors when using this code, make sure that you have the devtools package installed.

### Who made this package?
This package was created by Professor Sean Raleigh and undergraduate student Jack Wilburn. We are both at Westminster College in Utah and members of an on campus society called QUARC (QUantative Analysis and Research Co-operative).
