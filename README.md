# datafinder
The datafinder function will search a package for data frames and will return useful information about the variables and their types. Hopefully there will be more information available in the future. (For example: Is there missing data? How many factors are present? Are numerical variables normally distributed?) This will be especially useful for statistics educators who are always on the lookout for example data sets that have the features needed for the topic at hand.
