Package: datafinder
Type: Package
Title: Catalog the variables in available data sets
Description: The datafinder function will search a package for data frames and
    will return useful information about the variables and their types.
    Hopefully there will be more information available in the future.
    (For example: Is there missing data? How many factors are present?
    Are numerical variables normally distributed?) This will be especially
    useful for statistics educators who are always on the lookout for
    example data sets that have the features needed for the topic at hand.
