Type: Package
Title: Catalog the variables in available data sets
Description: The datafinder function will search a package for data frames
    and will return useful information about the variables and their types.
    Hopefully there will be more information available in the future.
    (For example: Is there missing data? How many factors are present?
    Are numerical variables normally distributed?)
